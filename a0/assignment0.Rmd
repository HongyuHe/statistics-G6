### Exercise 0.6
#### 1. Plots for (a), (b), (c)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%', out.height = '50%'}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))

# 0.6 a
sample1_data=as.matrix(read.table("sample1.txt"))
dimnames(sample1_data) <- list(
  list("a","b","c", "d"), 
  list("I", "II", "III", "IV", "V")
)
hist(
  sample1_data, 
  probability = T, 
  breaks = 5,
  main = "Histogram of Sample 1"
)

# 0.6 b
x  = seq(0, 2, 0.001)
y1 = x^4 
y2 = 5*x + 2

plot(
  x, y1, col = "blue", type = "l",
  main = "Plot for y1(x) and y2(x)",
  xlab = "x",
  ylab = "y"
)

  lty=1:2,

# 0.6 c
load("Ass0.RData")

barplot(
  table(school), 
  col = c("blue","green","black","yellow"),
  main = "Bar plot of \"school\" data"
)
```

#### 2. Plot for (d)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', out.height = '50%'}
# 0.6 d
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
proportions <- c(0.37,0.17,0.28,0.07,0.06,0.05)
food_lables <- c("Pear", "Cheesecake", "Chocolate", "Almond", "Strawberry", "Other")
pie(
  proportions,
  labels = food_lables,
  main="Sales proportions of pie flavours"
)
```

## *Appendix*
1. Exercise 0.6 (a)
